<h4>The NASA Space Project Web Application is a web-based project designed to provide users with information about planets and space missions.</h4>
</br>
 <h6>As a backend developer on the project, you were responsible for building and maintaining the server-side RESTful APIs that allowed users to retrieve planet data and launch planets based on a provided description. The APIs were designed to be efficient, secure, and scalable to handle large amounts of traffic. In addition to these features, you also implemented functionality that allowed the application to maintain descriptions of past and upcoming missions based on the launch mission API calls. This project involved collaborating with other developers to ensure that the backend architecture was compatible with the front-end interface, and that the application was responsive and user-friendly. Overall, your contribution to this project helped to make it a valuable resource for anyone interested in space exploration and NASA missions.</h6>
